STA261 is intended to be a rigorous (but friendly) introduction to mathematical statistics for students in the Theory and Methods Statistics Specialist program at the University of Toronto (UofT). I taught this course four times, from 2020 to 2024. The content here is mainly from the Summer 2024 offering.

Fisher and Pearson openly despised each other, and neither of them had warm personalities to begin with. In these two remarkable papers, Fisher and Pearson use the academic publication as a medium to publicly attack one another. Both papers are dripping with sarcasm and scorn, which you can easily get a sense of even if you skip past all the math.)

It's not an urban legend; the guy was a real person named George Dantzig, an outstanding mathematician who later went on to invent the simplex algorithm (if you ever did/do take a course in optimization, you'll learn about it), among many other things. The university class was a statistics course, and the professor teaching the lecture was Jerzy Neyman (he of the Neyman-Pearson lemma and much else). The problems were both conjectures related to hypothesis testing, and Neyman encouraged Dantzig to publish his proofs of the conjectures, which he did (and then stapled them together into what became his PhD thesis). The linked paper is the first of the two. After Module 3, you should have seen enough about hypothesis testing -- and -tests in particular -- to understand most everything up until the end of Section 2 of the paper, including the statement of the problem that Dantzig solved.)

# A linear congruential generator: starting with an initial X_{0}, we recursively update X_{i+1} = c + a*X{i} (mod m) 
# for some fixed c, prime number a, m and then return (X_{0}, ..., X_{n})/m

  }
  return(X / m)

#### Asymptotics in Action

If you know some basic R and you've worked through the assignment, try to figure out what this does and then run it. If you aren't amazed, you should be!

```r
set.seed(123456)
wald <- 0
score <- 0
J <- 1000
N <- 10000

for (j in 1:J) {
    dat <- rnorm(n=N, mean=10, sd=sqrt(4))
    vardat <- (1/N)*sum((dat-10)^2)

    L_w <- (1-sqrt(2/N)*1.96)*vardat
    U_w <- (1+sqrt(2/N)*1.96)*vardat
    if (L_w < 4 && 4 < U_w) {
    wald <- wald + 1
    }

    L_s <- vardat/(1+sqrt(2/N)*1.96)
    U_s <- vardat/(1-sqrt(2/N)*1.96)
    if (L_s < 4 && 4 < U_s) {
    score <- score + 1
    }
}

score_conf <- score/J
wald_conf <- wald/J
```
