STA261 is intended to be a rigorous (but friendly) introduction to mathematical statistics for students in the Theory and Methods Statistics Specialist program at the University of Toronto. I taught this course three times, from 2020 to 2022; content from the 2021 and 2022 offerings can be found [here](https://utstat.toronto.edu/~robert/teaching/sta261/).
