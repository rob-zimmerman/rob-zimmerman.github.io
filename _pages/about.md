Hello and welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD student in the University of Toronto's Department of Statistical Sciences, working under the supervision of [Prof. Radu V. Craiu](https://utstat.toronto.edu/craiu/). Previously, I obtained a B.Math in Mathematical Finance, Statistics, and Pure Mathematics at the University of Waterloo and then worked as a risk modeller in the finance industry for several years before entering the Statistics PhD program as a direct entry student. My research broadly focuses on dependence structures and copulas, as well as statistical computation (in both the frequentist and Bayesian realms); I also maintain keen interests in probability theory and mathematical finance.
