Hello and welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD candidate in the University of Toronto's Department of Statistical Sciences, working under the supervision of [Prof. Radu V. Craiu](https://utstat.toronto.edu/craiu/). Previously, I obtained a B.Math in Mathematical Finance, Statistics, and Pure Mathematics at the University of Waterloo in 2016 and then worked as a risk modeller in the finance industry for several years before entering the Statistics PhD program as a direct entry student in 2018. My research focuses broadly on dependence structures and copulas, as well as statistical computation (in both the frequentist and Bayesian realms); I also maintain keen interests in probability theory and mathematical finance.

Outside of academia, I enjoy watching [underperfoming sports teams](https://grantland.com/features/worst-sports-city-world/) and playing [outdated music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music) on the piano.
