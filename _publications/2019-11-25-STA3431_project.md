In this project, we explore methods for estimating expectations and variances of functionals with respect to the limiting distribution of the Anderson-Darling test statistic under the null hypothesis. We derive the density function for this complex distribution and implement efficient algorithms in R to compute it. We then evaluate the effectiveness of random-walk Metropolis, Metropolis-Hastings, and parallel tempering algorithms in sampling from the distribution.
