excerpt: '<p><i>STA4508H - Topics in Likelihood Inference (Prof. Nancy Reid, Winter 2022)</i></p>

In this project, we delve into a foundational paper on Edgeworth expansions and saddlepoint approximations by Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox (1979). Our focus is on tracing their derivations and discussing their statistical applications, including conditional likelihood inference and likelihood ratio tests within exponential family models. We follow their exposition closely, providing additional clarity on key derivations and examples, while highlighting the significant impact of their work on the development of modern asymptotic techniques in statistics.
