In this project, we simulate and analyze determinantal point processes (DPPs), a class of random point processes characterized by repulsion. We generate realizations of DPPs including the Gaussian unitary ensemble, circular unitary ensemble, complex Ginibre ensemble, and configurations of non-intersecting random walks. We compare the observed distributions to theoretical joint densities, which allows us to highlight the characteristic repulsion of these processes.
