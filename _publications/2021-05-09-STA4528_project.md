In this report, we review and implement an algorithm of Hofert for sampling from nested Archimedean copulas. We outline the foundational theory of Archimedean and nested Archimedean copulas, including their stochastic representations and sampling challenges. We then apply the sampling algorithm to a range of nested copulas, illustrating its computational efficiency and flexibility across different hierarchical structures. Our simulations highlight the algorithm&#39;s strengths, as well as potential limitations when working with non-standard Archimedean generators, offering insights for future applications and improvements.
