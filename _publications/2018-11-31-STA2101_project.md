In this project, we provide an introduction to the <i>c</i>-statistic, a measure of discrimination particularly suited to logistic regression. We discuss its advantages over pseudo-R-squared measures and its equivalence to the area under the ROC curve. Through practical examples, such as model selection on a dataset of student grades, we demonstrate the <i>c</i>-statistic&#39;s utility while addressing the potential of overfitting.
