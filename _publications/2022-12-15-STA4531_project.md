In this project, we critically examine the intersection of copulas and information geometry through a review of two key papers. The first paper explores variational Bayes inference using copulas by integrating a number of information-geometric principles, while the second investigates clustering multivariate time series by comparing divergences between copulas. Our report evaluates the theoretical contributions and practical implications of these works, highlighting their limitations and the challenges inherent in combining these two seemingly unrelated fields.
