In this report, we give an overview of the transport map MCMC algorithm, which integrates the theory of optimal transport into MCMC sampling to improve efficiency in exploring complex target distributions. We discuss the algorithm&#39;s use of transport maps to adaptively refine proposal distributions, thereby enhancing sampling performance (particularly in high-dimensional settings). We also examine the theoretical guarantees of ergodicity for the algorithm and discuss the potential for parallelization and future directions for extending the method to large-scale Bayesian problems.
